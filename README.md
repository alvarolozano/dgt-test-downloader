## DGT exam model downloader


This script allows to download exam models from DGT (dirección general de tráfico) `https://sede.dgt.gob.es/es/permisos-de-conducir/test-de-examenes/`

It was done by me from scratch by reverse-engineering website. I am currently studying for the driving license, so it should be useful to get up to date questions from real exams, and also, as online test websites are not mobile-friendly, develop a new front-end.
